<p>Having fear that his red hand is waking up, the blue boy Sig pulled himself out of the cafe team and ran off to the ruins. And just as he feared, it took him over. A witness who encountered Sig&rsquo;s red alter ego said that he is not the usual <em>shigu</em>. Another witness, who have tried to bring the blue out of the red but failed, mentioned that if he couldn&rsquo;t escape that condition, you can kiss his blue soul goodbye.</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>Sig? <em>(chuckles)</em> Sad to say, but that person is no longer with us&hellip; <em>(evil laugh)</em></dt>
<dd>&ndash; ?????, Sig&rsquo;s red side</dd>
<dt>Sig isn&rsquo;t gone.  He&rsquo;s faintly hanging onto himself. However, at this rate his sense of self will be gone.</dt>
<dd>&ndash; Lemres, witness #1</dd>
<dt><em>The Sig we&rsquo;re talking about right now isn&rsquo;t the Sig I know. And if we can&rsquo;t turn him back, will he be like this forever?</em></dt>
<dd>&ndash; Amitie, witness #2</dd>

<p>A similar case also wraps around me. The &lsquo;authority&rsquo; that is procrastination sets me back from taking classes for about a week. Then a group of people barged into my door and sorta interrogate me for my absence. Did it work? Only for a day or so, and then I went back into the deep until the outbreak forced the college to migrate to fully online until the end of the semester. Those people are practically like Lemres, they tried but failed. The red side of me just overwhelmed me and I fell for it so hard.</p>
<p>But hope is not entirely lost. I know I can get out of this darkness. I just need the willpower to do so. Or else, I&rsquo;ll be stuck in desperation and got sucked into the whirlpool into the void. I need something that drives me to act. I need&hellip; a motivation.</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>motivation</strong></dt>
<dd>willingness to do something, or something that causes such willingness.</dd>

<p>Why is this &ldquo;motivation&rdquo; so important in life? According to the answers in <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-do-humans-need-motivation">Quora</a>, motivation is the one that keeps live moving. It can help you recover from those dark days. It&rsquo;s essentially an &ldquo;urge&rdquo; to change one&rsquo;s condition from bad to good.</p>
<p>The quest for motivation is highly subjective and entirely personal. One may not have the same driving factor as another. Therefore, I&rsquo;m leaving this up to you to figure out.</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>I sense that he isn&rsquo;t giving in to the rampaging power, having a desire to return&hellip;</dt>
<dt>Sig is always going at his pace, and he&rsquo;s a little out there too&hellip;but deep down, his heart is strong.</dt>
<dd>&ndash; Lemres</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>But in the end, a motivation is just that, nothing else. An urge to change is simply an urge without an action. Therefore, we shall discuss &ldquo;action&rdquo; in part 3.</p>
<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR<a href="#tldr" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Motivation is the key to rise from your downfall. It&rsquo;s the one that drives you to take action. But motivation is useless without action.</p>
