<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>This is a reflection of my current state of mind. A rewind to the moments in
the last 6 months. Tides come and go, high and low. Rainbow cycles color from
blue to red, and back again. A glimpse of sapphire pass through.</p>
<p>Before we go into the topic, let&rsquo;s define a couple of terms.</p>
<h3 id="shigu">Shigu<a href="#shigu" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>The term &lsquo;<em>shigu</em>&rsquo; has no actual meaning. Instead, I refer to a being living in the town of Primp. He is known with his iconic red left hand and red left eye. Legend said that he might be related to a demon and assimilate with half of his body.</p>
<p>The person in question is named Sig. Here is a description from <a href="https://puyonexus.com/wiki/Sig">Puyo Nexus</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sig is a spacey boy, first introduced in Puyo Puyo Fever 2. Although he is sometimes shown smiling,
he lacks emotions through his text, and acts passively toward things, save for his great fascination with insects.
His lack of emotion in his speech lead to assumptions that he has some problems emoting.
According to Puyo Puyo Fever 2, he derives from the neutral non-evil parts of a demon, and is ignorant of his origins. His left eye is red and his left hand is a large red claw, denoting his demonic heritage.</p>
<p>Sig&rsquo;s lacks a lot of emotion, rarely raising his voice and treating everything in a nonchalant manner.
This often causes him to talk in a somewhat odd monotone voice. He&rsquo;s also notably rather absent minded, often failing to catch sarcasm or treating metaphors literally.</p>
</blockquote>

  </figure>


<p>Despite knowing that he might have a part of demon in him, he stays neutral and doesn&rsquo;t want to make chaos. This is apparent during <a href="https://puyonexus.com/wiki/Puyo_Puyo_Tetris">Tetromino blockage</a> when someone suggested Sig to &ldquo;embrace the coming chaos&rdquo; with his inner &ldquo;unnatural energy&rdquo;, in which he declined. In certain conditions, his anger may show up, especially when he sees a threat to those he cares about, like when a witch tries to take his ladybug for potions, or a warlock scaring a dragonfly off.</p>
<p><em>Shigu</em> will be the representation of me and my current state.</p>
<p>Here is a couple of <em>shigu</em> in action. The last one is actually me as the <em>shigu</em>.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;authority&rsquo; in <em>shigu</em> context may refer to his demonic left side. It has attempted to take over the main blue body previously, but was stopped. Had it not been stopped, it would consume its main personality, never to be seen again. Fortunately it didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>I define the &lsquo;authority&rsquo; here as the things that takes control over me: procrastination, ignorance, and carelessness. They are the &lsquo;red&rsquo; side of me</p>
<h2 id="the-meat">The &lsquo;Meat&rsquo;<a href="#the-meat" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just get to the point. I spent my last 6 months dealing with falling blocks and blobs, almost entirely ignoring the fact that I am a computer science student. As a student, especially a freshman, there are fundamental subjects to master, like English, math, physics, chemistry, and others. You might think, &ldquo;Wait, what does chemistry have to do with computer science?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the same thought as mine, as I see no short-term pupose and just gets in the way. Thanks to that self suggestion, I failed the subject horribly. I do feel math and English have a connection, but it didn&rsquo;t feel the same as physics. To add the extra load, physics has this lab practice session, which I failed to attend completely. And guess what? I failed that too.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;authority&rsquo; has taken control over me within the first 3 months. I went back home in heavy dissapointment in myself and my family. About a month and a half of break later, I returned back to college, not earning any value out of that holiday. It&rsquo;s essentially just an &lsquo;escape&rsquo;, where I go deeper into the study of falling blocks and Linux. I didn&rsquo;t learn anything, at least nothing I could remember. And that hits me again once I continue the study on the second semester.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m in a position where things can can barely salvaged. My current score is at the brink of failure, and 2 months into the second semester, I still destroying myself, regretting my past mistakes. Not exactly a regret, since I just tuck myself deeper into the blanket, into the comfort and tension of block puzzles nearly every single day. I am essentially destroying myself even further rather than fixing it.</p>
<p>At the moment of writing, I had to return to the safety of home to avoid the virus outbreak. During my times at home, I reflect hard upon myself and consult to my parents about my concerns of college being &ldquo;too hard&rdquo; or &ldquo;overwhelming&rdquo;. I realized that I have lost the motivation to act, causing me to slack off and &ldquo;filling the gaps&rdquo; with virtual blocks/blobs. I also ignored my current body condition and health, pointed out at a severe loss of weight on my already lightweight body. Yeah, I&rsquo;m a total mess.</p>
<p>I just simply don&rsquo;t know what to do. When playtime is restricted, workload increases, and stress builds up, the brain is overloaded to think further out like usual. I could just keep on going with what I&rsquo;m currently doing, and I might just survive. But that&rsquo;s not the case. I have to find a solid source of motivation, and fast.</p>
<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR<a href="#tldr" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>I have been slacking and destroying myself for the last 6 months, affecting my study progress. I returned home to evade the pandemic outbreak and hopefully regain control over myself.</p>
